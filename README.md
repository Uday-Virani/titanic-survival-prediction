# titanic-survival-prediction
### Discription:
This project was developed during my internship at Prodigy Infotech. It explores the famous Titanic Dataset to predict passenger survival using Machine Learning models. The project includes data preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and predictive model building.     

### Key Features:
âœ… Data Cleaning & Preprocessing      
âœ… Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Visualizations        
âœ… Machine Learning Model Development      
âœ… Model Evaluation & Insights          
   
### Technologies Used:
Python        
Pandas, NumPy       
Matplotlib, Seaborn       
Scikit-learn         

### Objective:
Understand key factors influencing passenger survival and build predictive models for accurate survival predictions.     

### Dataset: 
Kaggle Titanic Dataset
